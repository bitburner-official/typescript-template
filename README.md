## Dependencies

[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) required for compiling typescript and installing dependencies

## Installation

```
git clone https://github.com/bitburner-official/typescript-template
npm i
```

## How to use this template

Write all your typescript source code in the `/src` directory

To autocompile as you save, run `npm run watch` in a terminal

## Imports

To ensure both the game and typescript have no issues with import paths, your import statements should follow a few formatting rules:

- Paths must be absolute from the root of `src/`, which will be equivalent to the root directory of your home drive
- Paths must contain no leading slash
- Paths must end with no file extension

### Examples:

To import `helperFunction` from the file `helpers.ts` located in the directory `src/lib/`:

```js
import { helperFunction } from "lib/helpers";
```

To import all functions from the file `helpers.ts` located in the `src/lib/` directory as the namespace `helpers`:

```js
import * as helpers from "lib/helpers";
```

To import `someFunction` from the file `main.ts` located in the `src/` directory:

```js
import { someFunction } from "main";
```

## Deugging

For debugging bitburner on Steam you will need to enable a remote debugging port. This can be done by rightclicking bitburner in your Steam library and selecting properties. There you need to add `--remote-debugging-port=9222` [Thanks @DarkMio]
